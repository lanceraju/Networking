"# Networking" 
Algorithm enlisted imitates the 'Sliding Window ARQ' paradigm, coded in Java, executable via CLI. Output is kinda messy, but the structure is pretty neat.


The project itself is designed to run in two separate command prompts; one runs the Server (receiver) and one runs the Client (sender).


Step 1) Type things into Client  
Step 2) Hit Enter key  
Step 3) ????  
Step 4) Profit!    


  
-(How to run for begineers)-

1.) Open two command prompts and enter this into each: "path = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\bin" in both (or whatever directory path your Java\jdk folder is in; the one supplied here is just the current default for most). 

2.) Change the directory by running "cd C:\folder-you-put-the-java-files-in" 

3.) Enter 'javac Client.java' and 'javac Server.java' in either command prompt (or both. It doesn't matter)

4.) Enter 'java Server' into ONE command prompt and then enter 'java Client' into the OTHER command prompt

5.) The client functions as the sender and the server is the receiver. type stuff into the client, hit enter, and watch the Server go nuts. 

6.) Have fun!
